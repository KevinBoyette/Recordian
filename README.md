### Introduction
Recordian is the application that helps you keep a record of your work logs so you never miss a beat! Recordian acts as an electronic logbook that helps you keep a consistent record of details pertaining to each work day. I created Recordian for my father as a solution to the problems he encountered while trying to maintain a paperback logbook. Check out the [Recordian wiki](https://github.com/kwilliams3/Recordian/wiki) for more information about why and how Recordian was developed!

### Getting Started


##### Prerequisites
You must have [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) installed on your computer.

##### Download
Click "recordian.jar" under the downloads section of the [latest release](https://github.com/kwilliams3/Recordian/releases).

*Note: You may receive a warning stating that recordian.jar could be harmful to your computer. Your browser provides this warning because malicious software developers could choose to store malware in a .jar file that could cause problems for your computer. As such, most browsers will prompt you to keep the file if you know you've downloaded it from a trusted source or discard the file.*

##### Install
Once the download has finished, move the JAR file to a more permanent location such as your Documents folder or even your Desktop.

##### Usage
If you are using Windows, you should be able to double-click the JAR file to launch the program. Alternatively, you can launch the program by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory where the JAR file is stored, and entering the command `java -jar recordian.jar`
<br>
<br>
The program should launch, and a new folder will be created called *Recordian_Files*. This folder should not be moved or edited. It is where the database and defaults are stored.
