# Recordian
(Check out the [Recordian wiki](https://github.com/kwilliams3/Recordian/wiki) to learn why and how Recordian was developed!)

## Getting Started


#### Prerequisites
You must have [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) installed on your computer.

#### Download
The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/kwilliams3/Recordian/releases).

#### Install
Once the download has finished, move the JAR file to a more permanent location such as your Documents folder or even your Desktop.

#### Usage
If you are using Windows, you should be able to double-click the JAR file to launch the program. Alternatively, you can launch the program by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory where the JAR file is stored, and entering the command `java -jar recordian.jar`
<br>
<br>
The program should launch, and a new folder will be created called *Hour_Tracker_Files*. This folder should not be moved or edited. It is where the database and defaults are stored.
